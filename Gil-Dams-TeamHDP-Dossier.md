## Analyst Assessment

**Gerardo Gil Dams is a cybercriminal using anti-Maduro hacktivism as cover.** The political operations (airport hack, SEBIN leaks, Hezbollah exposure) are real but serve as a shield — they generate international press, build legitimacy, and create a "freedom fighter" narrative that deflects from the criminal operations underneath.

The money comes from: ransomware (Medusa, Blackmatter, Lockbit 2.0), extortion/blackmail of public figures, selling stolen data to hostile nations (allegedly Iran, Russia, Cuba — the same regimes he claims to oppose), credit repair hustle (TurboCredit), and PPP loan fraud.

When confronted, his instinct was not to deny but to flex — "Google my name." That's not a political dissident. That's someone who thinks their reputation makes them untouchable.

Multiple independent sources (Newman Perez, @estafascrypto, Venezuelan media) have called him out as an extortionist and scammer. Investigated for drug trafficking and sexual crimes beyond political charges. Deployed ransomware against his own country's telecom, then leaked millions of Venezuelan citizens' data when the ransom wasn't paid.

**Bottom line:** Hacktivism for legitimacy. Cybercrime for profit.

## N33 / Juan Manuel Almeida Morgado (ADVERSARY — DECEASED)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Full Name** | Juan Manuel Almeida Morgado |
| **DOB** | January 25, 1980 |
| **Died** | May 15, 2023 (under house arrest, Maracay) |
| **Cedula** | C.I. 14.060.444 |
| **Alias** | N33, Hacker N33 |
| **Side** | Pro-Chavismo (OPPOSITE of TeamHDP) |

### N33 Group (Almeida Brothers)
1. Carlos Jesus Almeida Morgado (C.I. 11.979.648, @ChuchoAlmeida)
2. Juan Manuel Almeida Morgado (C.I. 14.060.444)
3. Jorge Luis Almeida Morgado (C.I. 16.436.259, @Numbmax)

### Activities
- Hacked opposition figures and journalists for SEBIN
- Victims: Nelson Bocaranda, Berenice Gomez, Ibeyise Pacheco, Leonardo Padron
- Close to **Tareck El Aissami** since 2012 (El Aissami: OFAC-designated narcotics kingpin Feb 2017, arrested April 2024, accused $21B PDVSA embezzlement, provided passports to Hamas/Hezbollah via ONIDEX — 173 suspicious passports, 10,400+ issued to Lebanon/Syria/Iran citizens 2010-2019)
- Leaked audio of pro-govt TV host Mario Silva
- Supported by Venezuelan Navy, DGIM, SEBIN

### Death
- April 5, 2023: SEBIN raided his home — arrested for PDVSA-Crypto scandal
- Found with: grenades, assault rifle, official government credentials
- Accused of manipulating Sunacrip (crypto regulator) systems to divert cryptocurrency
- Died May 15, 2023 under house arrest — officially "cirrhosis"
- Death suspicious — similar to other PDVSA-Crypto detainee deaths
- El Aissami himself arrested April 2024 alongside Samark Lopez Bello (frontman who managed 40+ front companies) and former Finance Minister Simon Zerpa — charged with misappropriation, influence trafficking, money laundering, **treason**

### Relationship to TeamHDP
N33 was TeamHDP's **enemy**, not ally. Pro-government hacker who attacked opposition. TeamHDP's SEBIN/DGCIM leaks exposed the intelligence apparatus N33 worked within. The same leaks also exposed the Maklad crime family's Hezbollah connections on Margarita Island.

## Connection to Hector (Mexico)

- Hector is a Mexican national who plays both sides (white hat / black hat)
- Connected to Gil Dams / VECERT — Gil published a Mexican gov attack before it hit any forum
- This proves direct communication between Hector and Gil
- Hector's crew involved in carding and selling dumps
- Also connected to an unidentified Venezuelan hacker
- Source for this connection: Eme Dv (@dagga.boy on Instagram)

---

## BreachForums Network (Likely Connected to Gil Dams)

VECERT publishes breach alerts via @VECERTRadar on X. In multiple cases, VECERTRadar published breach details **BEFORE** they appeared on forums — proving Gil Dams has direct access to the breach actors or IS the breach actor.

| Actor | Platform | Known Breaches | Link to TeamHDP |
|-------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **malconguerra2** | BreachForums | Cashea 79M records (VZ fintech), Peru courts 1.9GB, UNMSM Peru 290K | VECERTRadar published Cashea BEFORE forums. Possibly Gil Dams himself. |
| **HvckMvSoneria33 / BlackHex Brotherhood** | BF + Telegram | 250K Colombian passports, Cashea first disclosure (Dec 2025) | LATAM targeting matches TeamHDP pattern |
| **Gordon Freeman** | BF + Telegram | Cashea 30K+, Bancrecer VZ 65K banking records, **Spain Ministry of Science** | Spain + VZ targeting mirrors TeamHDP's PSOE + LATAM pattern |

Gordon Freeman's **Spain Ministry of Science** hack is critical — TeamHDP previously breached Spain's PSOE. Same country, same MO.
