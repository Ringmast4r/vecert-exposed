  - "mal con guerra" = "bad at war" in Spanish — fits Venezuelan slang
  - If Gil Dams IS malconguerra2, he posts breaches then "reports" on them through VECERT to look legit
  - Targeting pattern (Venezuelan fintech + Peruvian government/academic) consistent with TeamHDP's LATAM focus
- **Sources:** BeInCrypto, puntodecorte.net, VECERTRadar on X, Alph4_Sec on X

## Maklad Crime Family — EXPOSED BY TEAMHDP

Druze-origin crime clan from As-Suwayda, southwestern Syria (near Jordanian border). Operating out of Nueva Esparta state (Margarita Island), Venezuela for **FOUR GENERATIONS**. Exposed by TeamHDP's DGCIM/SEBIN intelligence breach in October 2021. First published by **Israel Hayom** on October 26, 2021. Also covered by JNS, Breitbart, IFMAT, i-AML, DataBreaches.net.

Family described as "sole owners" of Santiago Marino Caribbean International Airport (IATA: PMV). A local source quoted: **"They are very protected and don't get off the island. It's their kingdom, and they have immunity."** Airport officially operated by state-owned Bolivariana de Aeropuertos (BAER) — Maklad control is de facto, not de jure.

Direct ties to former VP **Tareck El Aissami** (OFAC-designated narcotics kingpin since Feb 2017, arrested in Venezuela April 2024, accused of embezzling $21 BILLION from PDVSA).

**HEZBOLLAH CONNECTION:** Marshall Billingslea (former US Treasury Asst Secretary for Terrorist Financing) described Margarita Island as **"Hezbollah's most important base of operations in the Western Hemisphere."** Hezbollah established paramilitary training site on the island under Chavez. ~400 Hezbollah commanders reportedly relocated to South America after Israeli strikes in Lebanon (Saudi press, April 2025).

**NO OFAC SANCTIONS on Maklad family specifically** — significant gap given severity of allegations. Related designated individuals: Tareck El Aissami, Samark Lopez Bello, Ghazi Nasr al-Din, Fawzi Kan'an (all Hezbollah-Venezuela network).

**NOTE:** Walid Makled Garcia ("El Turco") is a SEPARATE Syrian-Venezuelan drug kingpin (arrested 2010, sentenced 14.5 years). Similar name, different family.

### Jalal Maklad (FC Profile #15)
- **Nationality:** Syrian (Druze)
- **Origin:** As-Suwayda, Syria
- **Location:** Nueva Esparta (Margarita Island), Venezuela
- **Status:** CRITICAL — Active
- **Operations:** Cocaine trafficking, strategic mineral smuggling (likely coltan/gold from Orinoco Mining Arc), **international terror financing**
- **Key Intel:** Primary financial operator. Directly involved in Hezbollah's financial pipeline — terror financing explicitly listed alongside narcotics. Identified in leaked DGCIM intelligence files
- **Source:** Israel Hayom (Oct 26, 2021), JNS, IFMAT

### Rabi Maklad (FC Profile #16)
- **Nationality:** Syrian (Druze)
- **Origin:** As-Suwayda, Syria
- **Location:** Margarita Island, Nueva Esparta, Venezuela
- **Status:** CRITICAL — Active
- **Operations:** Cocaine trafficking, strategic mineral trade, **trafficking of women and minors**, money laundering to finance terrorism
- **Key Intel:** Most operationally connected of the three brothers. Described as **"one of the organized crime heads with trade ties in Colombia."** Colombian connection significant — exploits Margarita Island's proximity to Colombia and the established Hezbollah trade-based money laundering route between Margarita and Maicao, Colombia
- **Source:** Israel Hayom (Oct 26, 2021), JNS

### Majdi Maklad (FC Profile #17)
- **Nationality:** Syrian (Druze)
- **Origin:** As-Suwayda, Syria
- **Location:** Margarita Island, Nueva Esparta, Venezuela
- **Status:** CRITICAL — Active
- **Operations:** Cocaine trade, **weapons and ammunition trafficking**
- **Key Intel:** Arms trafficking distinguishes him from Jalal (minerals/financing) and Rabi (human trafficking/Colombia). Connects to broader Caribbean weapons pipeline
- **Source:** Israel Hayom (Oct 26, 2021), JNS

### Hayyan al-Matthani (FC Profile #18)
- **Nationality:** Syrian (Druze community)
- **Location:** Nueva Esparta, Venezuela / Caribbean
- **Status:** CRITICAL — Active
- **Operations:** Arms and ammunition trade with **British Virgin Islands** and **Dutch Caribbean islands** (likely Curacao, Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Maarten)
