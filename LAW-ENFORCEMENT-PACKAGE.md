## RANSOMWARE DEPLOYMENT

TeamHDP has deployed or is accused of deploying:
- **Medusa** — Used against Digitel Venezuela (Feb 2024, $5M BTC demand)
- **Blackmatter** — Attributed by Venezuelan media and @estafascrypto
- **LockBit 2.0** — Attributed. LockBit separately claimed Federal Reserve breach (Jun 2024). Same ransomware family, same target, overlapping timeline.

## CONNECTED BREACHFORUMS ACTIVITY

VECERT (@VECERTRadar on X) published breach details BEFORE they appeared on forums, proving Gil Dams has direct access to breach actors or IS the breach actor:

| Forum Actor | Breaches | Connection Evidence |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| **malconguerra2** | Cashea (79M records, Venezuelan fintech), Peru courts (1.9GB), UNMSM Peru (290K) | VECERTRadar published Cashea BEFORE forums. Possibly Gil Dams. |
| **HvckMvSoneria33 / BlackHex Brotherhood** | 250K Colombian passports, Cashea first disclosure (Dec 2025) | LATAM targeting pattern matches TeamHDP |
| **Gordon Freeman** | Cashea, Bancrecer Venezuela (65K banking records), **Spain Ministry of Science** | Spain + VZ targeting mirrors TeamHDP's PSOE + LATAM pattern |

## ALLEGATIONS AGAINST TEAMHDP (per multiple sources)

- Ransomware deployment: Medusa, Blackmatter, LockBit 2.0
- Extortion of Venezuelan entertainment figures, politicians, public figures
- Doxing campaigns — coercing hacked individuals into becoming informants (those who refuse get publicly doxed)
- Selling stolen data to **Iran, Palestine, Russia, Cuba** (the same regimes they claim to oppose)
- Trafficking exploitation material via Telegram
- Exchanged sensitive info from US/Canada/Portugal/Brazil/Colombia embassies with Islamic groups on hacker forums
- Operating 15+ digital extortion portals (via Castro Fernandez family) demanding $70K+ per target

## EVIDENCE OF ADMISSION

Gil Dams responded to the victim's investigation via Instagram DM (@ggild1983) with:

> "You got me, Cameron. I'm sorry you support a terrorist regime while living in the United States. Google my name along with the words 'teamhdp' and then you'll cry."

This constitutes an admission of identity and association with TeamHDP.

## THREATS AGAINST VICTIM

**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Nature:** Threats against victim AND victim's family. Subject attempting to identify and dox victim.
**Platform:** [TO BE FILLED — add screenshots and platform details]
**Content:** [TO BE FILLED — paste exact threat text here]
**Prior Admission:** Instagram DM from @ggild1983 (see above)

**NOTE:** Subject has a documented pattern of doxing individuals who challenge him. TeamHDP's MO is: hack/obtain personal info → publish on portal network → demand payment to remove → escalate if target does not comply.

## VECERT TECHNICAL EVIDENCE (Cybercrime Infrastructure)

Gil Dams operates VECERT as a front that scrapes cybercrime forums and ships stolen data:

| Repo | Records | Content |
|------|---------|---------|
| DarkForumCTI | ~44,448 | Dark forum users, breach listings, exploit sales |
| LeakBaseCTI | ~134,652 | 125K user profiles, breach catalogs, stealer logs |
| XSS.isCTI | ~50,374 | 19 years of Russian hacking forum posts |
| Analyzer API | 403,927+ | BreachForums, XSS, Cracked, XForums aggregated |
| **TOTAL** | **633,401+** | |

**Hardcoded stolen credentials** found in public GitHub code:
- ProtonMail session tokens (UID, cookie, session ID)
- DarkEye platform session tokens
- Google Analytics tracking IDs
- Pickle files containing `cne.gob.ve` (Venezuela elections data)

**API endpoint** `vecertapi.com/api_analyzer` had NO authentication, NO rate limiting — anyone could dump 403K+ criminal forum posts. Now returning 404 (possibly taken down after victim's investigation).

Gil Dams has an account on **XSS.is** — the same Russian cybercrime forum his tools scrape.
